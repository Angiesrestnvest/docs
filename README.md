# Introduction

## Converting HTML/CSS into images

No dependencies to manage. Super simple HTTP API. We've figured out the complexities and details of rendering images from HTML for you.

Your code is run in an isolated instance of Google Chrome. Allowing us to replicate the exact, high quality image you're looking for.

## Examples

The API can be used to programmatically render images from any HTML/CSS. Autogenerate images from your applications backend.

### Social Sharing Cards

Generate social cards for your content on the fly. Fill in your `og:image` tags automatically, resulting in more sharing and clicks across Twitter and Facebook. Here's an example.

## Get an API key

To use this API, you'll first need an API key. You may retrieve one by [signing up here](https://htmlcsstoimage.com).

## Start creating images from HTML/CSS

Now that you have an API key, get started [creating your first image](getting-started/creating-an-image.md).
