## Development

This is a static site generated by Jekyll and served from [Cloudflare Workers](https://blog.cloudflare.com/workers-sites/).

To run it locally, you need Ruby installed.

1. Install the gems

```
bundle install
```

2. Start the development server

```
HCTI_API_KEY=key bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
```

`HCTI_API_KEY` is only required to be set for production. You can set it to a fake value for development.

## Production

Docs are built and deployed with GitHub Actions.
