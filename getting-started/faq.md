# FAQ

## **I need to generate a large amount of images one time, which plan should I use?**

If an existing monthly plan does not fit your needs, please email us at: **support@htmlcsstoimage.com** with the number of images you need to generate. We can send you a one time invoice and credit your account with the number of images you need to generate.

## **Can I use external CSS stylesheets?**

Yes, embed the `link` tag in your HTML and it will be loaded on render. Multiple CSS files are supported. Large files may slow down initial render time. See this [CodePen for an example](https://codepen.io/mscccc/pen/eLRLQq).

## **How do I render an entire webpage?**

When passing your HTML to the API, include the full HTML markup. Starting and ending with the `<html>` tags. The HCTI API will enter full page mode and render the entire page as displayed by Google Chrome.

## **How long will my image url work?**

Forever. As long as your HCTI account is active, we keep a copy of your generated image stored and accessible from your image url.

## **Can I load external images?**

Yes, be sure to include the full URL to your external image. The API will load it before creating the image. `<img src="https://example.com/yourimage.png" />`

## **How do I upgrade my account?**

You may change your plan anytime by visiting the [Dashboard](https://htmlcsstoimage.com/dashboard).

## **How much bandwidth can I use?**

All images served by the [hcti.io](https://hcti.io) domain are cached by Cloudflare's global content delivery network. Bandwidth is unlimited and paid for as a part of your subscription.

## **Can I use the API for a hackathon?**

Definitely. If you're a student and using the API to build something cool. Email us and we'd be happy to add free images to your account.

## **What version of Google Chrome does HCTI use?**

We regularly keep HCTI up-to-date with the latest version of Chrome. We run a full test suite to ensure images render as expected before upgrading the API.

## **I have other questions, who do I ask?**

Email us! **support@htmlcsstoimage.com**. We'd love to hear from you.
