# Zapier Integration

### Add the integration

Our Zapier integration is currently in beta. With it you can use the HTML/CSS API without writing any code.

Add the Zapier integration to your account by [**clicking here**](%20https://zapier.com/platform/public-invite/9032/818bf02a72301968dcb7c7461cb4c521/).

### Use it in a Zap

Once it's added to your account, you will be able to use it by creating a new Zap, and searching for "HTML/CSS" when adding an action to your zap.
