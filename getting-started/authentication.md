# Authentication

When [creating a new image](creating-an-image.md), you'll need to authenticate your account by using your user id and api key. Downloading an image does not require any authentication.

We use [HTTP Basic authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication). For details on how to do this, see the [code sample](../#quick-start) for the language you are using.

Your username is your **User ID** and your password is your **API Key**. Both of these are available from the [dashboard](https://htmlcsstoimage.com/dashboard).
