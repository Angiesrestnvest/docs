# Full page images

To render a full webpage, pass the full HTML markup. Starting and ending with the `<html>` tags. The API will enter full page mode and render the entire page as displayed by Google Chrome.

When rendering a full page, be sure to include full paths to all outside assets so that the API is able to download them. Relative paths will not work.

Here we passed the full HTML of Stripe's homepage.
