## Generating images from emails
The API takes your HTML/CSS and runs it inside a real instance of Google Chrome to convert your html into an image.

This works great for both HTML emails and full webpages.

For more details on how this works, see [Creating an image](/getting-started/using-the-api#creating-an-image).

<div class="code-example" markdown="1">
  <div class="hcti-container">

## Include full `<html>`

To render a full email or webpage with the API, pass the full HTML markup. Starting and ending with the `<html>` tags.

- The API will enter full page mode and render the entire page as displayed by Google Chrome.

- When rendering a full page, be sure to include full paths to all outside assets so that the API is able to download them. Relative paths will not work.
